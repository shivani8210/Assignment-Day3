Q1. What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it with an example?

Ans. Static Variables- It belongs to class. It can be accessed using className.memberName. It initializes with default values at the time of class loading. All objects of a class share a single copy of static variables.

     Non-Static Variables- It belong to object. It can be accessed using objectName, memberName. It initializes with default values at the time of object creation. Each object has one local copy of the non-static variables.

Example-
		
		package com.shi;

		public class StaticNonStatic 
		{
			int y = 21;
			void fun1() 
			{
				System.out.println("this is Function");
			}
			public static void main(String[] args) 
			{
				StaticNonStatic d1 = new StaticNonStatic();
				System.out.println(d1.y);
				d1.fun1();
			}
		}
